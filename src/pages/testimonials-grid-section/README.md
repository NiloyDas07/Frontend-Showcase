## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- The concepts of CSS Grid have become much clearer to me. I now feel more comfortable and confident using Grid in my future projects. Earlier, I just used Flexbox everywhere, regardless of the layout.

- I learnt about BEM and tried using it for the first time.

### Useful resources

- [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - A great resource to learn more about CSS Flexbox, Grid, and more.
