## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

First of all, I learnt how helpful detailed figma files are! Having accurate measurements saves so much time.
Moving on to the project, this time I learnt how to use our custom cursors. I didn't know how to do that cause most of the time I am just focused on the page design and layout. Never thought about styling the cursor before this challenge, so this was fun. ðŸ˜Š
